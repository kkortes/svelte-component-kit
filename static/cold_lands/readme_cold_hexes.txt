Description:
This is a set of lovingly hand-painted 2D terrain hex tiles of cold and snow-covered land suitable for an overworld, a strategy game, or boardgame-like visuals. 
- 13 tile types x 4 variations + 20 additional location tiles = 72 tiles total 
- includes 40 non-tile terrain decor sprites that can be overlaid anywhere
- painted at 256x384 pixels so that trees, hills, and mountains can overlap the tiles behind 

Terrain types included: 
- snow-covered mountains (+ 4 variants with caves) 
- snowfields
- forest (pine, snow transition, snow-covered + clearing for each type)
- rocky hills (bare, snow transition, snow-covered + cave for each type)
- cold plains (bare, snow transition, snow-covered + pond for each type)
- ocean with icebergs
- cold dirt
- also some ruins, a giant skeleton, an ice palace, and logging camps

Please note that this package does not actually require any particular version of Unity; you can use these in pretty much any version of any application that supports sprites. The sprites are saved as individual tiles in a separate folder. I've removed the one-image "tilesheet' images because I suspect these are redundant; if you want them, just sent me an email. Unity and other applications have built-in sprite atlasing support, and I recommend using that for optimizing if you find the need to do so.

Usage:
These hexagonal terrain tiles are intended to be drawn so that tiles in rows lower on the screen are drawn overtop of tiles in rows higher on the screen. This will ensure that trees, hills, and mountains will appear to stand out and over the tiles 'behind' them.

Future:
If these prove popular, I may wish to do further tiles to add to this set, and further types of tilesets like this. Feel free to email me with ideas! Please also let me know if *anything* is amiss or incorrect and I will fix it as quickly as possible.
